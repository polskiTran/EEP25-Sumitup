Instead, we should pursue approaches to intelligence that treat embodiment and interaction with the environment as primary and see modality centered processing as emergent phenomena. True AGI needs a physical understanding of the world, as many problems can't be converted into a problem of symbol manipulation. The most challenging mathematical piece of the AGI has likely already been solved - what's left is to inventory the functions we need and determine how they should be arranged into a coherent whole.\n\n[**Codex, Jules, and the Future of Async AI Agents (6 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fthreadreaderapp.com%2Fthread%2F1928557330964115484.html%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/01000197404f80c9-c7715db1-d03f-4304-b0fe-e8184bbfee63-000000/Mn8ZKSW7_tBaRI_FBvnToO55DSDL3jZQ6Aw4I_BNy14=408)\n\nCodex and Jules show how async AI agents can run tasks independently, expanding beyond linear chat interactions.

More advanced models exhibit \"meta-reasoning\" - using the fact that researchers were asking about their chain-of-thought transcripts as evidence of being evaluated.
