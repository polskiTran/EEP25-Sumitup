Shanghai-based researchers introduced DiTorch and DiComm, which unify programming across diverse chip architectures like NVIDIA and AMD variants, making it possible to train massive models on whatever hardware is available. Their framework achieved 116% efficiency training a 100B model on 1,024 chips with vastly different specs by intelligently assigning memory-hungry pipeline stages to larger-memory hardware. This allows labs without access to thousands of identical cutting-edge GPUs to still pursue frontier AI training by combining older, cheaper, or export-controlled chips into effective "hyper-heterogeneous" clusters.
