[**Claude Squad (GitHub Repo)**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsmtg-ai%2Fclaude-squad%3Futm_source%3Dtldrai)

Claude Squad is a terminal app that manages multiple local agents in separate workspaces, allowing users to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. It can compute tasks in the background, manage instances and tasks in one terminal window, review changes before applying them, checkout changes before pushing them, and more. Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so there can be no conflicts. A video demo is available in the repository.

[**Weak-to-Strong Decoding for LLM Alignment (GitHub Repo)**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FF2-Song%2FWeak-to-Strong-Decoding%3Futm_source%3Dtldrai)

WSD is a novel method where a small aligned model drafts the start of a response, then a large base model continues it. This boosts alignment without harming performance.
