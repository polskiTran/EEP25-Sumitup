This blog compares three Microsoft security APIs for threat hunting: Azure Monitor API, which queries Sentinel data only; Graph API, which queries both Defender XDR and Sentinel data, and Defender ATP API, which is limited to Defender for Endpoint data. The Graph API is recommended as it offers unified access to both platforms and supports more data types, while the Defender ATP API has notable limitations, such as a 30-day query timeframe restriction. Each API needs specific permissions and has different rate limits, with the Graph API allowing over 45 calls per minute based on tenant size.

Uber initially employed various secrets management practices and vaults for different teams and clouds, which it consolidated into six vaults under the purview of its Secrets team. The Secrets team created scanners to perform real-time scanning and scheduled scanning to identify secrets usage in chat apps and code, as well as built APIs for automated secrets rotation from the centralized secrets vaults. The team also developed a secrets exchange system to distribute secrets to third-party vendors.

With the movement of detection engineering towards a detection-as-code model, detection engineers must also embrace software maintenance requirements. Maintenance can be broken down into four categories: corrective maintenance, which directly fixes an issue that is occurring; adaptive maintenance, which adapts the detection to changing requirements such as a new API; perfective maintenance, which focuses on improving the query, documentation, or adding new features; and preventative maintenance, which proactively seeks to address issues before clients identify them. Although all detection engineering teams must perform maintenance, there is a dearth of information and posts discussing it.

Fog ransomware operators attacked an Asian financial firm in May using Syteca monitoring and pentesting tools GC2, Adaptix, and Stowaway. They stayed in the network for two weeks before deploying ransomware. The attackers maintained persistence post-attack and utilized tools often linked to espionage, suggesting intelligence-gathering motives with ransomware as a secondary goal. Since May 2024, Fog ransomware has evolved from targeting US schools through compromised VPNs to exploiting Veeam vulnerabilities and shifted to email infections featuring provocative ransom notes mocking Elon Musk's DOGE agency.
